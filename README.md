## I. Purpose of This Guide

When machines no longer work, we still need to build, fight, and survive. A blacksmith, leatherworker, or armor-maker needs to know what they're working with — quickly and reliably.

This guide provides a **universal grading system** that any craftsman can use with simple tools. No electricity. No computers. Just your hands, some reference objects, and a basic testing station.

Every material — whether stone, metal, bone, hide, wood, or something from a creature never seen before — can be graded using this system.

The four core grades are:

| Code | Grade | Measures |
|------|-------|----------|
| **H** | Hardness Grade | How resistant to scratching/denting |
| **F** | Flex Grade | How stiff or bendy it is |
| **B** | Break Grade | How tough it is before shattering |
| **D** | Ductility Grade | How workable/forgeable it is |

A material is written as: **H\_/F\_/B\_/D\_** (e.g., `H7/F8/B4/D2`)

---

## II. The Four Core Grades

Each grade runs from **1 to 10**. Higher is "more" of that property.

### Hardness Grade (H1 – H10)

*How resistant is the surface to scratching and denting?*

| Grade | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| H1 | Easily scratched by fingernail | Chalk, soft clay, fat |
| H2 | Scratched by fingernail with effort | Graphite, lead, gold |
| H3 | Scratched by a copper coin | Copper, soft bone, some shells |
| H4 | Scratched by an iron nail | Iron, platinum, most animal teeth |
| H5 | Scratched by a steel knife | Hard steel, common glass |
| H6 | Barely scratched by steel knife | Hardened steel, good blades |
| H7 | Cannot be scratched by steel | Some gemstones, dense bone |
| H8 | Scratches steel easily | Topaz, hardened monster parts? |
| H9 | Scratches almost everything | Corundum, sapphire, ruby |
| H10 | Scratches all known materials | Diamond, or equivalent |

**Test:** Attempt to scratch the material with each reference tool in order. The highest tool that *fails* to scratch it determines its grade.

### Flex Grade (F1 – F10)

*How much does a standard sample bend under a standard load?*

| Grade | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| F1 | Bends freely with almost no force | Soft leather, cloth |
| F2 | Bends easily by hand | Rawhide, thin copper sheet, rope |
| F3 | Bends with moderate hand force | Thick leather, green wood |
| F4 | Bends with strong hand force | Dry hardwood plank, thick hide |
| F5 | Requires leverage or tools to bend | Wrought iron bar |
| F6 | Barely bends with tools | Mild steel bar |
| F7 | Extremely stiff, minimal bend under heavy load | Hard steel |
| F8 | Almost no visible bend | Dense ceramics, thick bone |
| F9 | No measurable bend under any manual load | Tungsten-like |
| F10 | Perfectly rigid under all practical forces | Diamond-like |

**Test:** Use the Standard Bending Rig (see [Section IX](#ix-building-your-testing-station)). Place a sample across two supports, hang standardized weights from the center, and measure deflection.

### Break Grade (B1 – B10)

*How much impact energy can the material absorb before it fractures?*

| Grade | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| B1 | Shatters from a light tap | Thin glass, eggshell, charcoal |
| B2 | Breaks from a firm strike | Pottery, chalk, dried clay |
| B3 | Breaks from a hard hammer blow | Brick, some ceramics |
| B4 | Breaks from repeated hammer blows | Cast iron, some bone |
| B5 | Requires heavy strikes to fracture | Hardwood, antler |
| B6 | Very difficult to break by impact | Mild steel, dense wood |
| B7 | Resists most impacts | Quality steel, tough hide |
| B8 | Absorbs extreme impacts | Spring steel, layered materials |
| B9 | Nearly unbreakable by manual force | Some alloys, sinew-wrapped |
| B10 | Cannot be fractured by any known manual method | — |

**Test:** Use the Drop Tower (see [Section IX](#ix-building-your-testing-station)). Drop a standardized weight from increasing heights onto a supported sample. Record the height at which the sample cracks or shatters.

### Ductility Grade (D1 – D10)

*How much can the material be reshaped without breaking?*

| Grade | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| D1 | Cannot be reshaped; shatters or crumbles | Glass, chalk, charcoal, brittle ceramics |
| D2 | Slight reshaping before cracking | Cast iron, some crystals |
| D3 | Minor cold-working possible with care | Hard bronze, bone |
| D4 | Can be shaped with heat and effort | Wrought iron, some horn |
| D5 | Shapes well with heat | Mild steel, standard forging metal |
| D6 | Shapes well even cold | Copper, silver |
| D7 | Very easily shaped | Annealed copper, thin sheets |
| D8 | Can be drawn into wire or hammered very thin | Gold, lead |
| D9 | Extremely malleable and ductile | Pure gold, soft solder |
| D10 | Can be reshaped almost without limit | Theoretical perfect |

**Test:** Take a standard sample and attempt to bend it 90 degrees, first cold, then hot. Observe if it cracks, deforms cleanly, or snaps. Also try hammering flat.

> **Note on Heat:** Some materials change grade dramatically when heated. Always record both cold and hot grades where possible:
> `D3(cold) / D7(hot)` — hard to work cold, very workable hot.

---

## III. Testing Methods (No Technology Required)

Each test is designed to be performed by one or two people with simple tools.

### Scratch Test (for Hardness)

**Required tools (the "Scratch Kit"):**

1. Your fingernail
2. A copper coin or copper rod
3. An iron nail
4. A steel knife blade (known good steel)
5. A piece of quartz (common clear/white rock crystal)
6. A corundum fragment (if available — ruby, sapphire, emery stone)
7. A diamond chip (if available)

**Procedure:**

1. Clean the material surface.
2. Starting from softest tool (fingernail), firmly drag each tool across the surface with moderate pressure.
3. Check for a visible scratch mark (not just a color streak — wipe the area and look for an actual groove).
4. The grade equals the highest reference tool that *fails* to scratch the material, plus one.
5. If the material scratches your steel knife, it is at least H7. Continue with harder references if available.

**Tips:**
- Always scratch in the same direction.
- Use a magnifying lens if available to confirm fine scratches.
- Test multiple spots — some materials are harder on the surface.

### Bend Test (for Flex)

**Required tools:**
- The Standard Bending Rig (two supports, one span apart)
- A set of standardized weights (see [Section IX](#ix-building-your-testing-station))
- A measuring stick marked in small increments

**Procedure:**

1. Prepare a sample of standard dimensions:
   - **Bar:** 1 hand-span long, 1 thumb-width wide, 1 finger thick
   - **Sheet:** 1 hand-span long, 4 fingers wide
2. Place the sample across the two supports of the bending rig.
3. Hang the lightest weight from the center point.
4. Measure how far the center sags below the support line.
5. Add heavier weights step by step, recording sag each time.
6. Compare sag values to the Flex Grade reference table.
7. If the sample breaks during testing, note the weight and record this for the Break Grade as well.

**Standard Weight Set:**

| Weight | Approximate Mass |
|--------|-----------------|
| Weight 1 | ~0.5 kg (a small stone, the size of a fist) |
| Weight 2 | ~1 kg |
| Weight 3 | ~2 kg |
| Weight 4 | ~5 kg |
| Weight 5 | ~10 kg |
| Weight 6 | ~20 kg |

> Calibrate your weights against water: 1 liter of water = 1 kg

### Drop Test (for Break Grade)

**Required tools:**
- The Drop Tower (a tall post with height markings, and a guide channel for the drop weight)
- A standardized drop weight (~2 kg iron block or heavy stone)
- A flat anvil or stone base

**Procedure:**

1. Prepare a standard sample (same dimensions as Bend Test).
2. Place the sample flat on the anvil/base with slight overhang or supported at the ends (bridged).
3. Raise the drop weight to the lowest height mark (~10 cm).
4. Release the weight so it falls onto the center of the sample.
5. Inspect for cracks, chips, fractures, or full break.
6. If intact, increase height and repeat.
7. Record the height at which the material first shows damage, and the height at which it fully breaks.
8. Compare to the Break Grade reference table.

### Forge Test (for Ductility)

**Required tools:**
- A hammer (medium weight)
- An anvil or large flat stone
- A heat source (forge, campfire with bellows, or equivalent)
- Tongs

**Cold Test:**

1. Take a small sample bar.
2. Attempt to bend it 90 degrees by hand or with pliers.
3. Observe: Does it bend cleanly? Crack? Snap?
4. Attempt to hammer it flatter.
5. Count how many hammer strikes before cracks appear.

**Hot Test:**

1. Heat the sample until it glows (if it can — note the color).
2. Attempt bending and hammering again.
3. Compare performance to cold test.
4. Record both grades.

## IV. Secondary Properties

Beyond the four core grades, these additional properties are useful. Record them when possible.

### Weight Class (W1 – W5)

*Relative density / how heavy the material feels for its size.*

| Grade | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| W1 | Very light | Cork, dry softwood, some foams |
| W2 | Light | Hardwood, bone, leather |
| W3 | Medium | Stone, common metals like iron |
| W4 | Heavy | Lead, gold, dense alloys |
| W5 | Extremely heavy | Tungsten-like, osmium-like |

**Test:** Compare a fist-sized piece to fist-sized references of known weight class. Water is approximately W3 for reference.

### Heat Resistance (T1 – T5)

*How the material behaves when exposed to heat.*

| Grade | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| T1 | Burns or melts in campfire | Wood, leather, tin, lead |
| T2 | Softens in a forge | Copper, bronze, gold, silver |
| T3 | Requires strong forge to soften | Iron, mild steel |
| T4 | Barely affected by a standard forge | Hardened steel |
| T5 | Unaffected by any fire we can produce | Some ceramics, unknown monster materials? |

**Test:** Hold a sample at the edge of a campfire for a count of 60. Then hold it in a forge at full heat. Observe melting, softening, glowing, charring, or no change.

### Edge Holding (E1 – E5)

*How well the material keeps a sharp edge after use.*

| Grade | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| E1 | Dulls almost instantly | Lead, pure copper, gold |
| E2 | Dulls quickly with use | Bronze, wrought iron |
| E3 | Holds an edge with regular sharpening | Mild steel |
| E4 | Holds a keen edge for extended use | High carbon steel |
| E5 | Almost never dulls | Obsidian, diamond-edged?, unknown |

**Test:** Sharpen a small blade of the material. Cut through rope or leather repeatedly. Count cuts before the edge fails to slice cleanly.

### Water Resistance (R1 – R3)

| Grade | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| R1 | Absorbs water, weakens or rots when wet | Wood, cloth, paper |
| R2 | Mildly affected by water over time | Iron (rusts), some bone |
| R3 | Completely unaffected by water | Gold, stone, glass, ceramics |

### Toxicity (X0 – X3)

> **IMPORTANT:** Always test with caution.

| Grade | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| X0 | Safe to handle and wear against skin | — |
| X1 | Safe to handle briefly; wash hands after | Some ores, lead |
| X2 | Causes irritation; wear gloves | Certain monster parts? |
| X3 | **DANGEROUS.** Do not handle without protection. Fumes may be harmful. | Arsenic-bearing ores, some unknown materials |

**Test:** Rub a small amount on the inside of your wrist. Wait. *(Only for small, cautious tests. If any irritation, stop immediately.)*

**Better method:** Place material near ants or small insects. If they avoid it or die, treat it as X2 or higher.

## VII. Unknown Materials: How to Identify and Log Them

When you encounter a new material — especially from an unknown creature or a source that didn't exist before — follow this procedure:

### Step 1: Observe

- Color, texture, smell, weight in hand.
- Does it look like anything familiar? (Bone-like? Metal-like? Stone?)
- Is it warm or cold to the touch?
- Does it have any unusual features? (Glows, hums, pulses, etc.)
- **CAUTION:** Do not lick, inhale dust, or rub on bare skin until toxicity is checked.

### Step 2: Toxicity Check (FIRST!)

- Place a small piece near insects. Observe reaction.
- Rub on a covered area of skin through cloth. Wait.
- If safe so far, brief bare skin contact on wrist. Wait one hour.
- Assign X grade before proceeding with other tests.

### Step 3: Run the Four Core Tests

- Scratch test → **H** grade
- Bend test → **F** grade
- Drop test → **B** grade
- Forge test → **D** grade

### Step 4: Run Secondary Tests

- Weigh it → **W** grade
- Heat it → **T** grade
- Sharpen and cut-test → **E** grade
- Soak in water → **R** grade

### Step 5: Record Everything

Fill in a Material Profile Sheet ([Section V](#v-material-profile-sheet)). Give it a name. If you don't know what it is, name it by source and appearance:

- `"Red Boar Tusk"` — H6/F7/B5/D3 | W3 T3 E4 R2 X0
- `"Cave Serpent Scale"` — H8/F4/B7/D2 | W2 T4 E- R3 X1

Store the profile with a sample piece for others to reference.

### Step 6: Share the Knowledge

- Post the profile at your workshop or trading post.
- Teach others to test materials the same way.
- **Consistency is everything.** Use the same testing rig and weights.

## VIII. Crafting Recommendations by Profile

General guidelines for what material profiles are good for.

### Blade / Cutting Weapon
> **Ideal:** H6+, F6+, B5+, D4+, E4+

You want hardness (holds an edge), stiffness (doesn't flex on impact), decent toughness (doesn't shatter), and enough ductility to actually forge it. Edge holding is critical.

*Best known material:* Hard/high carbon steel — `H6/F7/B6/D4/E4`

### Blunt Weapon (Hammer, Mace)
> **Ideal:** H4+, F6+, B7+, D3+, W3+

Hardness matters less. You want it heavy, stiff, and tough.

*Best known materials:* Dense stone, cast iron head on wood handle.

### Armor (Plate)
> **Ideal:** H5+, F6+, B7+, D4+, W2-3

Must be hard enough to resist penetration, tough enough to absorb hits without cracking, and light enough to wear. Workability needed to shape it. **This is the hardest combination to find.**

*Best known material:* Mild to medium steel — `H5/F6/B7/D5/W3`

### Armor (Flexible — Chain, Scale, Lamellar)
> **Ideal:** H4+, F3-5, B6+, D5+

Needs to flex with the body but still resist cuts. Toughness is more important than hardness here.

### Shield
> **Ideal:** B8+, F4-6, W1-2

Toughness is king. Must absorb impacts without shattering. Weight should be manageable. Wood-and-leather composite works well.

### Bow / Flexible Weapon
> **Ideal:** F2-4, B8+, D5+

Must flex significantly and spring back without breaking. Combination of flexibility and toughness is critical.

*Best known materials:* Yew wood, horn-sinew composite.

### Tool Handle
> **Ideal:** F3-4, B7+, D(any), W1-2

Needs some flex to absorb shock, must not break, and light enough to swing all day.

*Best known material:* Ash wood, hickory.

### Building / Structural
> **Ideal:** F7+, B6+, W2-3

Must be stiff and tough. Weight is less critical.

### Jewelry / Decoration
> **Ideal:** D7+, R3, any H/F/B

Needs to be shapeable and resistant to tarnish/corrosion.

### Rope / Binding
> **Ideal:** F1-2, B9+

Must be very flexible and nearly impossible to break by pulling.

*Best known materials:* Sinew, plant fiber, braided leather.

### Fire / Heat Applications
> **Ideal:** T4+

Forge lining, fire shields, cooking surfaces, kiln building.

## IX. Building Your Testing Station

Every workshop should have a dedicated testing station. Here's how to build one with no technology.

### The Scratch Kit

Collect and label these items. Keep them in a pouch or wooden box:

1. Copper piece (coin, wire, or rod)
2. Iron nail
3. Steel knife (known standard — protect this, don't use it for anything else)
4. Quartz crystal
5. Any harder reference stones you can find

Label each item with its Hardness grade.

### The Bending Rig

**Construction:**
- Two upright posts, firmly planted, exactly **one hand-span** apart (measure and mark your standard span on a stick — use this forever as your standard).
- A flat, level support surface on each post at the same height.
- A hook or notch at the center point between the posts, below the supports, for hanging weights.

**Standard Sample Size:**
- Length: 1.5 hand-spans (so it overhangs each support)
- Width: 1 thumb-width
- Thickness: 1 finger-width (pinky)
- **Always cut samples to this size for consistent results.**

**Measuring:**
- Mark a vertical stick in even increments (use a knotted string for consistent spacing).
- Measure the sag at center under each weight.

### The Drop Tower

**Construction:**
- A tall post or frame, at least 2 arm-lengths high.
- A vertical guide channel (two parallel boards or rails) so the drop weight falls straight.
- Height markings every half-hand-span up the post.
- A flat, hard base (stone slab or anvil) at the bottom.

**Drop Weight:**
- A dense, uniform weight, ~2 kg.
- Ideally iron or a very dense stone, shaped into a block.
- Must fit smoothly in the guide channel.

**Standard Sample:**
- Same dimensions as bending test.
- Supported at both ends (bridged), centered under drop point.

### Standardized Weights

Calibrate using water:
- Find or make a watertight container of known volume.
- 1 liter of water = 1 kg (approximately).
- Fill a container, then find stones/metal that balance against it.
- Mark and label your weights clearly.

**Recommended set:** 0.5 kg, 1 kg, 2 kg, 5 kg, 10 kg, 20 kg

Keep these at your testing station. Do not use them for other purposes.

### The Forge Test Area

- A small anvil or flat stone surface near your forge.
- Hammer of known weight.
- Tongs.
- Mark a 90-degree angle on your anvil for consistent bend tests.

---

## X. Final Notes

**Consistency is everything.**
The exact numbers don't matter as much as everyone using the *same* standards. If your hand-span is your unit, use the same hand (or better, a marked measuring stick) every time. If your drop weight is a specific stone, keep that stone and never swap it.

**Teach others.**
This system only works if craftsmen everywhere use the same method. When trading materials, share the profile. When training apprentices, teach them to test first.

**Trust the tests, not your eyes.**
A shiny material isn't always strong. A dull one isn't always weak. Monster parts may look terrifying but test as H2/B2 — useless. Or a plain-looking bone might test at H8/F6/B8/D3 — treasure. Always test. Always record.

**Update this guide.**
As new materials are found, add them to the reference table. As testing methods improve, refine them. This is a living document.

**When in doubt, combine.**
No single material is perfect for everything. The best gear is often made from layered or combined materials:
- Hard blade edge + tough blade spine
- Rigid plate over flexible padding
- Stiff frame with flexible joints

Understanding each material's profile lets you combine them intelligently.
